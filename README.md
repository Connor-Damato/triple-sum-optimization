# Triple-Sum-Optimization

This program is written to test a possible optimization for the triple sum problem. 

The triple sum problem involves finding three numbers in a list that add up to a given target sum. Given an array of integers and a target sum, the goal is to determine if there are three distinct elements in the array whose sum is equal to the target sum.
